# Story points we implemented

- (3 Story Points) Add more buttons. Currently, the 4-button interface severely limits the movement of users. To improve the hardware, I suggest modifying the board to have 8 buttons, maintaining the current diagonal movements, but also adding orthogonal movements. This will require re-wiring the board (I have bigger breadboards to assist with this) and adding in 4 more digital read pins that need to have their state broadcasted over serial.
- (3 Story Points) From my user studies, I have learned that a lot of users feel limited by the 1 unit movements of each button press. As a potential solution, I suggest that we add a potentiometer to the board, where each player's movement can be scaled based on the current reading of the potentiometer. This will require adding the circuitry for the potentiometer to the current game controller, utilizing the ADC on the RP2040 to read the state of the potentiometer, and broadcasting this reading over serial.
- (3 Story Points) Some of our users aren't the biggest fans of our terminal-based interface. One improvement that could be made is adding an actual GUI to run our game. I highly recommend using one of rust's crates that make generating GUIs very easy! One example is [egui](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/).

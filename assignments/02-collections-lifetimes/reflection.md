Trying to figure out how to use the fold function was one of the hardest
learnings of this assignment. I personally found it less readable when I finally
figured out how to implement these iterators within the accumulator and store
information that was necessary over multiple value sections. There is a certain
elegance to implementing with chains of functions and it was very nice not
having to deal with borrowing and mutability. I imagine the readability and ease
of implementation will increase as I get better at functional thinking. I
believe the prescriptive style is more scalable as it allows arbitrary values to
be added without respecifying the accumulator in every return possibility.
